  }
]

Requirements:
1. Return valid JSON only (no markdown, HTML, or explanatory text).
2. The entire output must be a single JSON array (no additional keys).
3. Each object must contain:
   - "content" (string)
   - "speaker" (the character or narrator who is attributed to the dialogue)
   - "gender" (either "M" or "F")
4. Do not include anything beyond the JSON (no extra commentary).
5. DO NOT skip ANY elements in the list. Everything must be present in the JSON dump.
